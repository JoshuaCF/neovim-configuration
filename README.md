# Personal neovim config

Just my personal Neovim settings. That's all.

The following external tools might need to be available:

`ripgrep` (for Telescope live grep)
`lua-language-server` (for lua lsp support)
`clangd` (for C/C++ lsp support)
`rust-analyzer` (for Rust lsp support)
`asm-lsp` (for assembly lsp support)
`typescript-language-server` (for TypeScript lsp support)
a c/c++ compiler (for treesitter rebuilding, usually a given on Linux but I need this to remind myself on Windows)
`tree-sitter-cli` (again, treesitter)
